Participated in the [EMBO Population Genomics: Background and Tools Course](https://meetings.embo.org/event/24-pop-genomics) in Naples, Italy. Presented a [poster](https://www.jeangilder.it/pop-genomics/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Abhilesh_Dhawanjewar.pdf) on the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation in detecting sexually antagonistic selection. Lots of in-depth discussions on the use of population genomic tools in understanding complex evolutionary processes.
