Attended the [EMBO\|FEBS Lecture Course: The Evolving Role of Mitochondria in Metabolism](https://meetings.embo.org/event/25-mitochondria) in Belgrade, Serbia. Presented my work on the statistical modeling of a somatic mtDNA bottleneck from our [recent mtDNA-smFISH study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.24.634671v1) and served as a panelist on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion. The conference highlighted technical advances and was full of stimulating discussions on the evolving landscape of mitochondrial biology.
