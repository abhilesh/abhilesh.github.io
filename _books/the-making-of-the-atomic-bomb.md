A single sentence to summarise this book - 'It is a masterpiece'.

Richard Rhodes takes us back to the 20th Century when the world is gripped in the midst of the Second World War. In a spectacular, comprehensive account of the making of the atomic bomb that put an end to the Second World War, the author provides a perfect balance of the scientific, technical, political and ethical aspects of the journey that led to Nagasaki and Hiroshima being decimated by 'Fat Man' and 'Little Boy'. RR begins with the scientific discoveries in the late 19th century of the subatomic particles which led to the idea of harnessing the energy inside an atom. At each stage, the author provides brilliant and brief biographical sketches of the protagonists involved which includes familiar names such as Leo Szilard, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr to name just a few.

If you are a science fan, you will love the historical narrative of the scientific discoveries that marked the golden age of physics. If you are an engineering enthusiast, the author will not disappoint you with his in-depth descriptions of the technical difficulties that needed to be overcome in order to build a functioning atom bomb. If you are a political science person, you will learn about the political decisions that led to the United States dropping the bombs on Japan. In short, just give it a read.
