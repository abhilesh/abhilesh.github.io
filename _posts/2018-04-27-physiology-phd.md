The [Comprehensive Exam (or "comps")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_examination) is a notoriously stressful milestone in the PhD journey. It is a high-stakes exam that tests the student's knowledge of their field and their ability to think critically. The format of the exam varies by departments, but usually consists of both a written and an oral component. For my doctoral program, this involved writing a research proposal laying out the plans for my dissertation research, and then defending it in front of my doctoral committee, which comprised of five faculty members from related fields.

Notes:
Used the [Wahoo TICKR](https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/running/heart-rate-monitors/tickr-buy) heart rate monitor to capture the data, exported using the [Wahoo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wahoofitness.fitness&hl=en_US), cleaned up the data and plotted the graph in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Code for the plot available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/abhilesh/Miscellaneous_scripts/tree/master/PhD_Comps_HR).
