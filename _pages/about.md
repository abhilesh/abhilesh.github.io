I am an Evolutionary biologist passionate about understanding the mechanistic processes that produced the diversity of Life on Earth. I specialize in integrating empirical and computational approaches towards developing a holistic understanding of evolutionary processes.

Currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Genetics, Evolution and Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee) department at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with [Prof. Max Reuter](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/max-reuter) and [Dr. Aida Andres](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-aida-andres), my research focuses on how sex-specific traits evolve despite sharing a common genome. We use a combination of experimental evolution, genomics, and statistical modelling to understand the genetic basis of sexual antagonism.

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology from the [School of Biological Sciences](https://biosci.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). I worked with [Dr. Kristi Montooth](https://biosci.unl.edu/kristi-montooth) and [Dr. Colin Meiklejohn](https://biosci.unl.edu/colin-meiklejohn) on the co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Through phenotypic assays with _Drosophila_ hybrids, I characterized the effects of incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear interactions on the thermal senstivity of male reproduction. Combining phylogenetic, biological sequence and protein structure analysis, I also characterized disease-causing mutations in proteins of the electron transport chain.

I recieved my Integrated BS-MS Dual Degree in Bioinformatics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), where I worked on research projects in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Structural Biology. For my Masters thesis, I developed statistical methods to assess the stability of higher-order protein-protein interactions. This work is implemented as a webserver called [Protein Interaction Z-Score Assessment (PIZSA)](http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/pizsa/).
