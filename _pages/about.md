I am an Evolutionary biologist passionate about understanding the mechianistic processes that produced the diversity of Life on Earth. I specialize in integrating empirical and computational approaches towards developing a holistic understanding of evolutionary processes.

Currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Genetics, Evolution and Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee) department at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with [Prof. Max Reuter](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/max-reuter) and [Dr. Aida Andres](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-aida-andres), my research focuses on how sex-specific traits evolve despite sharing a common genome. We use a combination of experimental evolution, genomics, and statistical modelling to understand the genetic basis of sexual antagonism.

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology from the [School of Biological Sciences](https://biosci.unl.edu/) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). I worked with [Dr. Kristi Montooth](https://biosci.unl.edu/kristi-montooth) and [Dr. Colin Meiklejohn](https://biosci.unl.edu/colin-meiklejohn) on the co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Through phenotypic assays with *Drosophila* hybrids, I characterized the effects of incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear interactions on the thermal senstivity of male reproduction.
