I am an Evolutionary Biologist & Bioinformatician passionate about uncovering the mechanisms driving the diversity of life. My work integrates empirical and computational approaches to develop a holistic understanding of evolutionary processes.

Currently, I am a Bioinformatician at the [MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit](https://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.clinical-neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/), where I analyze multimodal single-cell data to investigate mitochondrial DNA mutations, their nuclear genome interactions, and disease implications.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Genetics, Evolution & Environment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), studying the evolution of sex-specific traits and the genetic basis of sexual antagonism using experimental evolution, genomics, and statistical modeling.

I earned my Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology from the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/), where I investigated mitochondrial-nuclear co-evolution in Drosophila. My research characterized the effects of mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibilities on male reproductive thermal sensitivity and used phylogenetics, sequence analysis, and protein structural modeling to study disease-causing mutations in electron transport chain proteins.

I hold an Integrated BS-MS in Bioinformatics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), where I conducted research in ecology, evolutionary biology, and structural biology. My Masterâ€™s thesis led to the development of [PIZSA](https://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/pizsa/), a webserver for assessing higher-order protein-protein interaction stability.

Beyond academia, I am the Technology Lead on [The Ealing Beaver Project](https://theealingbeaverproject.com/), an initiative reintroducing beavers to urban London to restore wetland ecosystems and mitigate flooding.  I conduct ecological surveys and investigate the use of AI technologies to enhance the analysis of ecosystem changes, including habitat restoration and water dynamics resulting from beaver activity.
